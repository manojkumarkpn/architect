#11 Use Generators and yield
"""
- A generator is a special type of iterator that allows you to iterate over a sequence of values without storing them all in memory at once.
- Instead of returning all values at once (like a list does), a generator produces values one at a time, on the fly, using the yield keyword.
- This is crucial for large data processing or streaming applications.

Resource safety: Avoids leaving PJSIP running if an exception occurs.

Cleaner code: No need to manually destroy PJSIP outside the block.

Reusable: You can use this pattern in any script that needs temporary PJSIP access.
